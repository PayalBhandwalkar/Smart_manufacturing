# Smart_manufacturing
This project implements a real-time IoT-enabled smart manufacturing system that detects equipment anomalies and predicts failures using AWS IoT Core, Amazon S3, Athena, and Power BI. The system collects sensor data, performs anomaly detection, and visualizes insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.
